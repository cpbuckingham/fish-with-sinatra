# Fishing with Sinatra

Let's build a web app to keep track of our favorite fish. There will be a home page
with links to details about each fish that we like. There are no wireframes so feel
free to lay out the app however you want. Please remember to use semantic HTML!

The real focus of this exercise is to practice writing acceptance tests with Capybara.
For each story, write an acceptance test that interacts with the site just like a
user would. For this app, that will mainly involve visiting pages by their URL and
clicking links, then expecting that the page has the correct content.

## Setup

1. Fork and clone this repository
1. Run `bundle install` from the project directory
1. Import the stories into a new Pivotal Tracker project
1. Start the first story. Write an acceptance that covers the requirements of the story
1. Write the code to make the story/test pass. Just get it to work and don't worry too much about how it looks or feels.
1. Refactor if necessary.
1. Repeat 4-6 for the remaining stories
